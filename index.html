  <h2>Hi, I'm Charlie,</h2>
  <p> I am a mechanical engineering student with the class of 2023. I have several
    years of formal work experience in the engineering field. Maybe more
    importantly though, I have a lifetime of tinkering and building.
    <br>
    Additionally, I am a member of the Penn Lightweight Rowing Team. The sport and
    community is something I have been around since the begining of high school. Our team is
    incredibly goal driven with hopes to win the Ivy League championship for the second
    year in a row this upcoming season.
    <br>
    Overall, I love collaborating and working with a team, whether it be in a boat race
    or in the lab. I especially enjoy working on long term goals.
    I'm always ready to take on new, challenging projects and hit the ground running!

  <h2>Aerial Filmmaking</h2>
  <p>
    As a high school student, I was fascinated by drones and aerial cinematography.
    The combination of technology and art made perfect sense and seemed like a never ending
    realm of possibility. <br>
    I began building my own drones and got licensed by the FAA to fly commercially (Part 107 license).
    To spread my name around the community I started working with local realtors to make short highlight reels of different properties. Eventually I was working enough that I was able to
    register my own aerial photography company and become the director of aerial photography for the media agency   <a href="https://creativemediaalliance.com/"  target="_blank" style="color:white;">Creative Media Alliance</a> (CMA). <br>
    After a number of shoots around the greater Washington area, a highlight reel of all
    the work I've done was put together by the editors at CMA - Click below.<br>

  <h2>Large Scale Fixed Wing Drones</h2>
  <p>
    While working as a UAV engineer with a collaborative team at Applewhite Aero,
    a Seattle based Drone manufacturing and design company, I was able to
    expand and learn a variety of valuable engineering skills. <br>
    I learned the intricacies of fiberglassing, laying carbon fiber, working
    with CNC mills, 3D printers, and large scale autopilot systems. However, most importantly
    I learned how to adapt to new problems that would arise while still working with a team.
    Keeping a level head while maintaining solid communication and working with a team was critical for success.

  <h2>Surfboards</h2>
  <p>
    This project started because I felt that consumer surfboards were far too
    espensive, so I gave it a shot myself.
    <br>
    After much trial and error, my most recent design (pictured below) is optimized to be lightweight,
    yet still strong and flexible enough for a wide range of situations.
    <br>
    The concepts behind building sufboards turned out to be far more complex than
    I originally expected. Any slight change in the shape of the board can completely alter the
    way the board works. It was increadibly interesting to research and see how different
    physical alterations related to the underlying physics concepts.
    I learned more than I ever thought during this fun, personal project, that ended up saving me a lot of money.
    <br>
    During the construction phase of this project I learned how difficult
    working with fiberglass and epoxy can be. However, after enough tries, it is
    a medium I now feel extremely comfortable working with.
    <br>
    As with any project there is always room for improvement and I hope to continue
    this hobby into the future with a more solidified understanding of the physics that make
    these boards work.

  <h2>3D Printing</h2>
  <p> 3D printing has been a part of so many of my projects, whether it's for work or a personal project.
  At a certain point I decided to build my own printer. I settled on a Core XY design, optimized for speed and accuracy
   with a lightweight print head.
  After finicking with the arduino and troubleshooting a number of problems at the begining, I had a working printer.
  From that point forward almost all the projects I've worked on have used this machine for prototyping as well as final production.
  As a result of this project I have a deep understanding of the principles and software that control most addative 3D printing designs.

  <h2>This Website</h2>
  <p>This website is made entirely from scratch using html, css, and javascript.
    I had no previous experience in web design before starting this projects but I was able to teach myself enough of the
    basics to make it work the way I wanted. I hope
    to add more features and pages soon but regardless, this project let me put my foot
    in the door and learn what the world of web design looks like.<br>
    All of the images featured on the site are also taken by me.</p>
